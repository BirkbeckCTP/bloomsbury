================

The Bloomsbury theme is an OLH subtheme, developed for use by UCL Press.

To install:

1. Clone this repository into src/themes/ using the command: git@bitbucket.org:birkbeckctp/bloomsbury.git OLH
2. You must either set the `INSTALLATION BASE THEME` setting to OLH or for the journals where you want to use the subtheme set the `Journal Base Theme` setting.
